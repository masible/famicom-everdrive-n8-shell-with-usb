# Shell for Famicom Everdrive N8, with USB port

This is a snap-shell for the Famicom Everdrive N8 with a hole for the optional, user-installed, USB port.

There's some information about installing the USB port [on the Krikzz forum](https://krikzz.com/forum/index.php?topic=2003.0). Labels used in photos available [on this forum thread](https://krikzz.com/forum/index.php?topic=333.0) ([cached here](labels/)). The tools to use the USB port are available [on Krikzz's FTP site](https://krikzz.com/pub/support/everdrive-n8/original-series/development/).
